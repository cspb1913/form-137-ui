# Role Authentication Fix

## Problem
Admin users like `jason@cspb.edu.ph` were showing up as "Requester" role instead of their proper "Admin" role when accessing the admin panel.

## Root Cause
The `/app/api/auth/me/route.ts` endpoint had a fallback mechanism that automatically assigned "Requester" role to any user when no roles could be extracted from the Auth0 token:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (problematic)
if (roles.length === 0) {
  roles = ["Requester"]  // This masked the real issue
}
```

This prevented proper role-based access control and made it impossible to diagnose role assignment issues.

## Solution
1. **Removed automatic fallback**: Users without roles now get an empty roles array instead of being defaulted to "Requester"
2. **Added proper warning logging**: When no roles are found, the system logs a warning with user details to help diagnose Auth0 configuration issues
3. **Improved error handling**: Users without valid roles are redirected to an improved unauthorized page with better messaging

## Key Changes

### `/app/api/auth/me/route.ts`
- Removed automatic "Requester" role assignment
- Added warning logging for debugging role extraction issues
- Preserved multi-location role extraction logic

### `/app/page.tsx`
- Added redirect to unauthorized page for users without valid roles
- Better handling of edge cases

### `/app/unauthorized/page.tsx`
- Improved user messaging explaining possible causes of access denial
- Better guidance for users experiencing role issues

## Testing
The fix ensures:
- ✅ Admin users with proper role claims retain "Admin" role
- ✅ Requester users with proper role claims retain "Requester" role  
- ✅ Users without roles get empty array (not defaulted to "Requester")
- ✅ Proper role-based access control is maintained
- ✅ Better debugging capabilities for Auth0 role configuration issues

## Auth0 Configuration
For this fix to work properly, ensure that user roles are properly configured in Auth0 using one of these methods:
- Custom claims: `https://form137portal.com/roles`
- App metadata: `app_metadata.roles`
- User metadata: `user_metadata.roles`
- Other supported claim locations (see code for full list)

The system will now properly reflect the actual role configuration instead of masking issues with automatic defaults.
